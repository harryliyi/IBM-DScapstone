    "Traffic accidents have become a big threat to public safety and resulted in great amounts of ecomoic loss around the world. A global status report on traffic safety indicated that the number of road traffic death continued to increase steadily, reaching to 1.35 million in 2016 [[WHO, 2018]](#cite-world2018global). Therefore, one of the important task for safety analysts and political makers, in order to mitigate the severity of the accidental consequence, is to make a comprehensive assessment of historical traffic accidents and then to increase the predictability of accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accident analysis and prediction has been discussed in many previous studies and covers a broad range of categories, including, for example, ***Environmental Stimuli Analysis***, ***Accident Frequency Prediction***, and ***Accident Risk Prediction*** [[Moosavi, et. al., 2019a]](#cite-moosavi2019accident). ***Environmental Stimuli Analysis*** assesses the environmental conditions (e.g. weather, and road conditions) that are correlated with the possibility or severity of traffic accidents. ***Accident Frequency Prediction*** is targeted on predicting the number of traffic accidents for a specific road-segment or geographical region. ***Accident Risk Prediction*** is similar to the previous one. However, instead of predicting the number of accidents, it is focusing on predict the possibility of road traffic accidents for real-tiem applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis in this work belongs to the first category as I tried to seek the potential environmental stimuli of road traffic accidents. I used several explory data analysis (EDA) tools to investigate heterogeneity in the environmental factors and assessed the impact of environmental stimuli on severity of the accidents in US using several different machine learning models. The results from my analysis may provide advice to political makers on whether new regulations are needed in specific roads or weather conditions to reduce the risk of traffic accidents. In addition, it may also give suggestions to car drivers to avoid certain raod segments or to be vigilant on certain environmental conditions."

    "The data set employed in this study is a countrywide traffic accident dataset (US-Accidents), which covers 49 states of the United States [[Moosavi, et. al., 2019b]](#cite-moosavi2019countrywide). The data were collected continuously from February 2016 to March 2019 and contains about 3.5 million accident records in total. This data set contains various attributs including time, location, severity and description of accidents, weather conditions, points of interest annotation (e.g. whether there is a Stop sign in a nearby location). A summary table of all data attributes is shown in [Table 1](#Table_1). Details of the attributes and data acquisition strategy can be found in [Moosavi, et. al., 2019b](#cite-moosavi2019countrywide). And the data set is available on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)."
